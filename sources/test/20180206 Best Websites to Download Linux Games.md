Where to download Linux games?
------------------------------

![Websites to download Linux games](https://itsfoss.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/download-linux-games-800x450.jpg)

First and foremost, look into your Linux distribution’s software center (if it has one). You should find plenty of games there already.

But that doesn’t mean you should restrict yourself to the software center. Let me list you some websites to download Linux games.

### 1\. Steam

If you are a seasoned gamer, you have heard about Steam. Yes, if you don’t know it already, Steam is available for Linux. Steam recommends Ubuntu but it should run on other major distributions too. And if you are really psyched up about Steam, there is even a dedicated operating system for playing Steam games – [SteamOS](http://store.steampowered.com/steamos/). We covered it last year in the [Best Linux Gaming Distribution](https://itsfoss.com/linux-gaming-distributions/) article.

Steam Store

Steam has the largest games store for Linux. While writing this article, it has exactly 3487 games on Linux platform and that’s really huge. You can find games from wide range of genre. As for [Digital Rights Management](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Digital_rights_management), most of the Steam games have some kind of DRM.

For using Steam either you will have to install the [Steam client](http://store.steampowered.com/about/) on your Linux distribution or use SteamOS. One of the advantages of Steam is that, after your initial setup, for most of the games you wouldn’t need to worry about dependencies and complex installation process. Steam client will do the heavy tasks for you.

GOG Store

Officially, GOG games support Ubuntu LTS versions and Linux Mint. So, Ubuntu and its derivatives will have no problem installing them. Installing them on other distributions might need some extra works, such as – installing correct dependencies.

You will not need any extra clients for downloading games from GOG. All the purchased games will be available in your accounts section. You can download them directly with your favorite download manager.

The Humble Store

Humble Store is famous for another reason though. They have a program called [**Humble Indie Bundle**](https://www.humblebundle.com/?partner=itsfoss) where they offer a bunch of games together with a compelling discount for a limited time period. Another thing about Humble is that when you make a purchase, 10% of the revenue from your purchase goes to charities.
